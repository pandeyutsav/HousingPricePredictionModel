2) perception and neural network

robots also have its perception. its just analysing the sensor data
{i/p layer
o/p layer
}
precision is a bsic layer. interconnections of a  lot of neurons together

3)CNN-conventional neural network-used for img processing 
eg-ig and snap
use for object reongnition {eg-google lens}
(SLAM)simluation localisation and mapping
COLLISION detecgtion and avaoidance -uses cnn algorithm
ti willbe finding out the edges and based on the dtaa it wil find out what king of figure is being given to the machne

4)open cv-img processiong -pre defined python lib for img manipulation, 
facial recognitition , gstural recognition

{OPEN CV2}

5_) ANN ARTIFICIAL neural network
similar to human brain all neurons will be to=talikng to each other talkimg to each other in form of nodes ///locomotion
uses NLP
if a sensor is working properly or not

NLTK library of python




serial cable add krni to port addd krna pdega
2911 router is the best
router do support kra hai  gig aur serial (red wala)
how to find effciciency in da
will accuracy change if dataset same system wahi methods bhi wahi lgega
